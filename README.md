# Live MBTA map
A web-based map of MBTA subway and commuter rail lines and all currently active trains. The trains can be seen moving every 30 seconds. Uses the Google Maps API for the map module and the real-time MBTA API for the train routes and locations. Backend was built with Node.js for quick development and easy Socket.io integration. The front end is a combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

The project is live here: http://cliffanderson.net/MBTA-map/
